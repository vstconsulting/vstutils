Backend API manual
==================

VST Utils framework uses Django, Django Rest Framework, drf-yasg and Celery.

Models
------

A model is the single, definitive source of truth about your data. It contains essential fields and behavior for the data youâ€™re storing.
Usually best practice is to avoid writing views and serializers manually,
as BModel provides plenty of Meta attributes to autogenerate serializers and views for many use cases.

.. automodule:: vstutils.models
    :members:

.. automodule:: vstutils.models.queryset
    :members:

.. automodule:: vstutils.models.decorators
    :members: register_view_action


Vstutils supports models that don't necessitate direct database interaction or aren't inherently tied to database tables.
These models exhibit diverse behaviors, such as fetching data directly from class attributes, loading data from files,
or implementing custom data retrieval mechanisms.
Remarkably, there are models that, in a sense, implement the mechanism of SQL views with pre-defined queries.
This flexibility allows developers to define a wide range of models that cater to specific data needs,
from in-memory models to those seamlessly integrating external data sources.
Vstutils' model system is not confined to traditional database-backed structures,
providing a versatile foundation for crafting various data representations.

Web API
-------

Web API is based on Django Rest Framework with additional nested functions.

Fields
~~~~~~

The Framework includes a list of convenient serializer fields. Some of them take effect only in generated admin interface.

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.fields
    :members:

Validators
~~~~~~~~~~

There are validation classes for fields.

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.validators
    :members:

Serializers
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.serializers
    :members: DisplayMode,DisplayModeList,BaseSerializer,VSTSerializer,EmptySerializer,JsonObjectSerializer

Views
~~~~~
VSTUtils extends the standard behavior of ViewSets from Django REST Framework (DRF) by providing
built-in mechanisms for managing model views that cater to the most commonly encountered development patterns.
This framework enhancement simplifies the process of creating robust and scalable web applications by offering
a rich set of tools and utilities that automate much of the boilerplate code required in API development.
Through these extensions, developers can easily implement custom business logic, data validation,
and access control with minimal effort, thus significantly reducing development time and improving code maintainability.

-------------

**An ETag** (Entity Tag) is a mechanism defined by the HTTP protocol for web cache validation and to manage resource versions efficiently.
It represents a unique identifier for the content of a resource at a given time, allowing client and server to determine
if the resource has changed without downloading the entire content.
This mechanism significantly reduces bandwidth and improves web performance by enabling conditional requests.
Servers send ETags in responses to clients, which can cache these tags along with the resources.
On subsequent requests, clients send the cached ETag back to the server in an If-None-Match header.
If the resource has not changed (the ETag matches), the server responds with a 304 Not Modified status, indicating that the client's cached version is up-to-date.

Beyond GET requests, ETags can also be instrumental in other HTTP methods like PUT or DELETE to ensure consistency
and prevent unintended overwrites or deletions, known as "mid-air collision avoidance."
By including an ETag in the If-Match header of non-GET requests, clients signal that the operation should proceed only
if the resource's current state matches the specified ETag, thus safeguarding against concurrent modifications by different clients.
This application of ETags enhances the reliability and integrity of web applications by ensuring that operations are performed on the correct version of a resource.

Here is main functionality provided for working with ETag's mechanism:


.. automodule:: vstutils.api.base
    :members: CachableHeadMixin,get_etag_value,EtagDependency

.. automodule:: vstutils.utils
    :members: check_request_etag

Actions
~~~~~~~

Vstutils has the advanced system of working with actions.
REST API works with data through verbs, which are called methods.
However, to work with one or a list of entities, such actions may not be enough.

To expand the set of actions, you need to create an action that will work with some aspect of the described model.
For these purposes, there is a standard :func:`rest_framework.decorators.action`, which can also be extended using the scheme.
But for the greater convenience, there is a set of decorator objects in vstutils to eliminate the routine of writing boilerplate code.

The main philosophy for these wrappers is that the developer writes business logic without being distracted by the boilerplate code.
Often, most of the errors in the code appear precisely because of the blurry look from the routine writing of the code.


.. automodule:: vstutils.api.actions
    :members:


Filtersets
~~~~~~~~~~

For greater development convenience, the framework provides additional classes
and functions for filtering elements by fields.

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.filters
    :members:


Responses
~~~~~~~~~

DRF provides a standard set of variables whose names correspond to
the human-readable name of the HTTP code.
For convenience, we have dynamically wrapped it in a set of classes
that have appropriate names and additionally provides following capabilities:

- String responses are wrapped in json like ``{ "detail": "string response" }``.
- Attribute timings are kept for further processing in middleware.
- Status code is set by class name (e.g. ``HTTP_200_OK`` or ``Response200`` has code 200).

All classes inherit from:

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.responses
    :members: BaseResponseClass


Middleware
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Django `supposes <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/middleware/#writing-your-own-middleware>`_
that a developer creates Middleware class manually, but it's often a routine.
The vstutils library offers a convenient request handler class for elegant OOP development.
Middleware is used to process incoming requests and send responses before they reach final destination.

.. automodule:: vstutils.middleware
    :members: BaseMiddleware,AsyncBaseMiddleware

Filter Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Filter Backends <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#djangofilterbackend>`_ are used to modify model queryset.
To create custom filter backend to, (i.g. annotate model queryset), you should inherit from :class:`vstutils.api.filter_backends.VSTFilterBackend`
and override :meth:`vstutils.api.filter_backends.VSTFilterBackend.filter_queryset` and in some cases
:meth:`vstutils.api.filter_backends.VSTFilterBackend.get_schema_fields`.

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.filter_backends
    :members:

Celery
------

Celery is a distributed task queue. It's used to execute some actions asynchronously in a separate worker.
For more details on Celery, check it's official `docs <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/>`_.
For Celery related vstutils features to work, you need to specify `[rpc] <config.html#rpc-settings>`_ and
`[worker] <config.html#worker-settings>`_ sections in settings.ini. Also you need to include extra [rpc] requirements.

Tasks
~~~~~

.. automodule:: vstutils.tasks
    :members: TaskClass

Endpoint
--------

Endpoint view has two purposes: bulk requests execution and providing OpenAPI schema.

Endpoint url is ``/{API_URL}/endpoint/``, for example value with default settings is ``/api/endpoint/``.

``API_URL`` can be changed in ``settings.py``.

.. automodule:: vstutils.api.endpoint
    :members: EndpointViewSet


Bulk requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk request allows you send multiple requests to api at once, it accepts json list of operations.

+-----------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| Method                            | Transactional      | Synchronous              |
|                                   | (all operations in | (operations executed one |
|                                   | one transaction)   | by one in given order)   |
+===================================+====================+==========================+
| ``PUT /{API_URL}/endpoint/``      | NO                 | YES                      |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| ``POST /{API_URL}/endpoint/``     | YES                | YES                      |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| ``PATCH /{API_URL}/endpoint/``    | NO                 | NO                       |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+

Parameters of one operation (required parameter marked by :superscript:`*`):

* ``method``:superscript:`*` - http method of request
* ``path``:superscript:`*` - path of request, can be ``str`` or ``list``
* ``data`` - data to send
* ``query`` - query parameters as ``str``
* ``let`` - string with name of variable (used for access to response result in templates)
* ``headers`` - ``dict`` with headers which will be sent (key - header's name, value - header's value string).
* ``version`` - ``str`` with specified version of api, if not provided then ``VST_API_VERSION`` will be used


.. warning::
    In previous versions header's names must
    follow `CGI specification <https://www.w3.org/CGI/>`_
    (e.g., ``CONTENT_TYPE``, ``GATEWAY_INTERFACE``, ``HTTP_*``)

    Since version 5.3 and after migrate to Django 4 names must follow HTTP specification instead of CGI.

In any request parameter you can insert result value of previous operations
(``<<{OPERATION_NUMBER or LET_VALUE}[path][to][value]>>``), for example:

.. code-block::

    [
        {"method": "post", "path": "user", "data": {"name": "User 1"}),
        {"method": "delete", "version": "v2", "path": ["user", "<<0[data][id]>>"]}
    ]

Result of bulk request is json list of objects for operation:

* ``method`` - http method
* ``path`` - path of request, always str
* ``data`` - data that needs to be sent
* ``status`` - response status code

Transactional bulk request returns ``502 BAG GATEWAY`` and does rollback after first failed request.

.. warning::
    If you send non-transactional bulk request, you will get ``200`` status and must
    validate statuses on each operation responses.

OpenAPI schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request on ``GET /{API_URL}/endpoint/`` returns Swagger UI.

Request on ``GET /{API_URL}/endpoint/?format=openapi`` returns OpenAPI schema in json format. Also you can specify required
version of schema using ``version`` query parameter (e.g., ``GET /{API_URL}/endpoint/?format=openapi&version=v2``).

To change the schema after generating and before sending to user use hooks.
Define one or more function, each taking 2 named arguments:

* ``request`` - user request object.
* ``schema`` - ordered dict with OpenAPI schema.

.. note::
    Sometimes hooks may raise an exception;
    in order to keep a chain of data modification,
    such exceptions are handled.
    The changes made to the schema before the exception however, are saved.

Example hook:
    .. sourcecode:: python

        def hook_add_username_to_guiname(request, schema):
            schema['info']['title'] = f"{request.username} - {schema['info']['title']}"

To connect hook(s) to your app add function import name to the ``OPENAPI_HOOKS`` list in ``settings.py``

.. code-block::

    OPENAPI_HOOKS = [
        '{{appName}}.openapi.hook_add_username_to_guiname',
    ]


Testing Framework
-----------------

VST Utils Framework includes a helper in base test case class and
improves support for making API requests. That means if you want make bulk request
to endpoint you don't need create and init test client, but just need to call:

.. sourcecode:: python

    endpoint_results = self.bulk([
        # list of endpoint requests
    ])

Creating test case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``test.py`` module contains test case classes based on :class:`vstutils.tests.BaseTestCase`.
At the moment, we officially support two styles of writing tests:
classic and simple query wrappers with run check and
runtime optimized bulk queries with manual value checking.


Simple example with classic tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, if you have api endpoint like ``/api/v1/project/`` and model Project
you can write test case like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from vstutils.tests import BaseTestCase


    class ProjectTestCase(BaseTestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            super(ProjectTestCase, self).setUp()
            # init demo project
            self.initial_project = self.get_model_class('project.Test').objects.create(name="Test")

        def tearDown(self)
            super(ProjectTestCase, self).tearDown()
            # remove it after test
            self.initial_project.delete()

        def test_project_endpoint(self):
            # Test checks that api returns valid values
            self.list_test('/api/v1/project/', 1)
            self.details_test(
                ["project", self.initial_project.id],
                name=self.initial_project.name
            )
            # Try to create new projects and check list endpoint
            test_data = [
                {"name": f"TestProject{i}"}
                for i in range(2)
            ]
            id_list = self.mass_create("/api/v1/project/", test_data, 'name')
            self.list_test('/api/v1/project/', 1 + len(id_list))


This example demonstrates functionality of default test case class.
Default projects are initialized for the fastest and most efficient result.
We recommend to divide tests for different entities into different classes.
This example demonstrate classic style of testing,
but you can use bulks in your test cases.


Bulk requests in tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk query system is well suited for testing and executing valid queries.
Previous example could be rewritten as follows:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from vstutils.tests import BaseTestCase


    class ProjectTestCase(BaseTestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            super(ProjectTestCase, self).setUp()
            # init demo project
            self.initial_project = self.get_model_class('project.Test').objects.create(name="Test")

        def tearDown(self)
            super(ProjectTestCase, self).tearDown()
            # remove it after test
            self.initial_project.delete()

        def test_project_endpoint(self):
            test_data = [
                {"name": f"TestProject{i}"}
                for i in range(2)
            ]
            bulk_data = [
                {"method": "get", "path": ["project"]},
                {"method": "get", "path": ["project", self.initial_project.id]}
            ]
            bulk_data += [
                {"method": "post", "path": ["project"], "data": i}
                for i in test_data
            ]
            bulk_data.append(
                {"method": "get", "path": ["project"]}
            )
            results = self.bulk_transactional(bulk_data)

            self.assertEqual(results[0]['status'], 200)
            self.assertEqual(results[0]['data']['count'], 1)
            self.assertEqual(results[1]['status'], 200)
            self.assertEqual(results[1]['data']['name'], self.initial_project.name)

            for pos, result in enumerate(results[2:-1]):
                self.assertEqual(result['status'], 201)
                self.assertEqual(result['data']['name'], test_data[pos]['name'])

            self.assertEqual(results[-1]['status'], 200)
            self.assertEqual(results[-1]['data']['count'], 1 + len(test_data))


In this case, you have more code, but your tests are closer to GUI workflow,
because vstutils-projects uses ``/api/endpoint/`` for requests.
Either way, bulk queries are much faster due to optimization;
Testcase execution time is less comparing to non-bulk requests.

Utils
-----

This is tested set of development utilities.
Utilities include a collection of code that will be useful
in one way or another for developing the application.
Vstutils uses mosts of these functions under the hood.

.. automodule:: vstutils.utils
    :members:


.. _webpush-manual:

Integrating Web Push Notifications
----------------------------------

Web push notifications are an effective way to engage users with real-time messaging.
To integrate web push notifications in your VSTUtils project, follow these steps:

1. **Configuration**: First, include the ``vstutils.webpush`` module in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` section of your ``settings.py`` file.
   This enables the web push functionality provided by VSTUtils. Additionally,
   configure the necessary settings as described in the web push settings section (see :ref:`here<webpush-settings>` for details).
2. **Creating Notifications**: To create a web push notification, you need to define a class that inherits from
   either :class:`vstutils.webpush.BaseWebPush` or :class:`vstutils.webpush.BaseWebPushNotification`.
   VSTUtils automatically detects and utilizes web push classes defined in the ``webpushes`` module of all ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
   Below is an example that illustrates how to implement custom web push classes:


   .. literalinclude:: ../test_src/test_proj/webpushes.py
       :language: python
       :linenos:

   This example contains three classes:

   - `TestWebPush`: Sends notifications to all subscribed users.
   - `TestNotification`: Targets notifications to specific users.
   - `StaffOnlyNotification`: Restricts notifications to staff users only. Sometimes you may want to allow only some users to subscribe on specific notifications.

3. **Sending Notifications**: To dispatch a web push notification, invoke the ``send`` or ``send_in_task``
   method on an instance of your web push class. For instance, to send a notification using `TestNotification`,
   you can do the following:

   .. code-block:: python

       from test_proj.webpushes import TestNotification

       # Sending a notification immediately (synchronously)
       TestNotification(name='Some user', user_id=1).send()

       # Sending a notification as a background task (asynchronously)
       TestNotification.send_in_task(name='Some user', user_id=1)

.. warning::
   The asynchronous sending of web push notifications (using methods like ``send_in_task``) requires a configured Celery setup
   in your project, as it relies on Celery tasks "under the hood".
   Ensure that Celery is properly set up and running to utilize asynchronous notification dispatching.


By following these steps, you can fast integrate and utilize web push notifications in projects with VSTUtils.


Troubleshooting
----------------------------------

Vstutils makes some errors more readable for common users and provides special error codes for administration to simplify troubleshooting.

* ``VE100-VE199`` - Database related errors.
    * ``VE100`` - Integrity error code. Used when ``django.db.utils.IntegrityError`` appears.
