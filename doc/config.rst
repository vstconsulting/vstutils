Configuration manual
====================

Introduction
------------
Though default configuration is suitable for many common cases, vstutils-based
applications is highly configurable system. If you need something more advanced
(scalability, dedicated DB, custom cache, logging or directories) you can configure
vstutils-based application deeply by tweaking ``/etc/{{app_name or app_lib_name}}/settings.ini``.

The most important thing to keep in mind when planning your application
architecture is that vstutils-based applications have a service-oriented structure.
To build a distributed scalable system you only need to connect to a shared database_,
shared cache_, locks_ and a shared rpc_ service (MQ such as RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.).
A shared file storage may be required in some cases, a but it isn't required by vstutils.

Let's consider the main sections of the config and its parameters:

|
|

.. _main:

Main settings
-------------

Section ``[main]``.

This section is intended for settings related to whole vstutils-based application
(both worker and web). Here you can specify verbosity level of vstutils-based
application during work, which can be useful for troubleshooting (logging level etc).
Also there are settings for changing of timezone for whole app and allowed domains.

If you want to use LDAP protocol, you should create next settings in section ``[main]``.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ldap-server = ldap://server-ip-or-host:port
    ldap-default-domain = domain.name
    ldap-auth_format = cn=<username>,ou=your-group-name,<domain>

ldap-default-domain is an optional argument, that is aimed to make user authorization easier
(without input of domain name).

ldap-auth_format is an optional argument, that is aimed to customize LDAP authorization.
Default value: cn=<username>,<domain>

So in this case authorization logic will be the following:

#. System checks combination of login:password in database;

#. System checks combination of login:password in LDAP:

   * if domain was mentioned, it will be set during authorization
     (if user enter login without ``user@domain.name`` or without ``DOMAIN\user`` );

   * if authorization was successful and there is user with mentioned login in database,
     server creates session for him.


* **debug** - Enable debug mode. Default: false.
* **allowed_hosts** - Comma separated list of domains, which allowed to serve. Default: ``*``.
* **first_day_of_week** - Integer value with first day of week. Default: ``0``.
* **ldap-server** - LDAP server connection.
* **ldap-default-domain** - Default domain for auth.
* **ldap-auth_format** - Default search request format for auth. Default: ``cn=<username>,<domain>``.
* **timezone** - Timezone of web-application. Default: UTC.
* **log_level** - Logging level. Default: WARNING.
* **enable_django_logs** - Enable or disable Django logger to output.
  Useful for debugging. Default: false.
* **enable_admin_panel** - Enable or disable Django Admin panel. Default: false.
* **auth-plugins** - Comma separated list of django authentication backends.
  Authorization attempt are made until the first successful one in order specified in the list.
* **auth-cache-user** - Enable or disable user instance caching. This is increase session performance
  on each request but saves model instance in unsafe storage (default django cache).
  The instance is serialized to a string using the :mod:`standard python module pickle <pickle>`
  and then encrypted with :wiki:`Vigenère cipher <Vigenère cipher>`.
  Read more in the :class:`vstutils.utils.SecurePickling` documentation. Default: false.

.. _database:

Database settings
-----------------

Section ``[database]``.

Here you can change settings related to database system, which vstutils-based application will
use. vstutils-based application supports all databases supported by ``django``. List of
supported out of the box: SQLite (default choice), MySQL, Oracle, or
PostgreSQL. Configuration details you can look at
:django_docs:`Django database documentation <settings/#databases>`.
If you run vstutils-based application at multiple nodes (clusterization), you should
use some of client-server database (SQLite not suitable) shared for all nodes.

If you use MySQL there is a list of required settings, that you should create for correct
database work.

Firstly, if you use MariaDB and you have set timezone different from "UTC" you should run
next command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

      mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root -p mysql

Secondly, for correct work of MariaDB you should set next options in ``settings.ini`` file:

.. sourcecode:: bash

      [database.options]
      connect_timeout = 10
      init_command = SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES', default_storage_engine=INNODB, NAMES 'utf8', CHARACTER SET 'utf8', SESSION collation_connection = 'utf8_unicode_ci'

Finally, you should add some options to MariaDB configuration:

.. sourcecode:: bash

      [client]
      default-character-set=utf8
      init_command = SET collation_connection = @@collation_database

      [mysqld]
      character-set-server=utf8
      collation-server=utf8_unicode_ci

.. _cache:

Cache settings
--------------

Section ``[cache]``.

This section is for settings related to cache backend used by vstutils-based application.
vstutils-based application supports all cache backends that Django supports.
Currently is: filesystem, in-memory, memcached out of the box and many more by
additional plugins. You can find details about cache configuration at
:django_docs:`Django caches documentation
<settings/#caches>`. In clusterization scenario we advice to share cache between nodes to speedup their
work using client-server cache realizations.
We recommend to use Redis in production environments.

|
|

.. _locks:

Locks settings
--------------

Section ``[locks]``.

Locks is system that vstutils-based application uses to prevent damage from parallel actions
working on something simultaneously. It is based on Django cache, so there is
another bunch of same settings as cache_. And why there is another
section for them, you may ask. Because cache backend used for locking must
provide some guarantees, which does not required to usual cache: it MUST
be shared for all vstutils-based application threads and nodes. So, in-memory backend, for
example, is not suitable. In case of clusterization we strongly recommend
to use Redis or Memcached as backend for that purpose. Cache and locks backend
can be same, but don't forget about requirement we said above.

|
|

.. _session:

Session cache settings
----------------------

Section ``[session]``.

vstutils-based application store sessions in database_, but for better performance,
we use a cache-based session backend. It is based on Django cache, so there is
another bunch of same settings as cache_. By default,
settings getted from cache_.

|
|

.. _rpc:

Rpc settings
------------

Section ``[rpc]``.

vstutils-based application uses Celery for long-running async tasks.
Celery is based on message queue concept,
so between web-service and workers running under Celery bust be some kind of
message broker (RabbitMQ or something).  Those settings relate to this broker
and Celery itself. Those kinds of settings: broker backend, number of
worker-processes per node and some settings used for troubleshoot
server-broker-worker interaction problems.

This section actual only with vstutils installed with `rpc` extra dependency.

* **connection** - Celery :celery_docs:`broker connection <userguide/configuration.html#conf-broker-settings>`. Default: ``filesystem:///var/tmp``.
* **concurrency** - Count of celery worker threads. Default: 4.
* **heartbeat** - Interval between sending heartbeat packages, which says that connection still alive. Default: 10.
* **enable_worker** - Enable or disable worker with webserver. Default: true.

|

The following variables from :celery_docs:`Django settings <userguide/configuration.html#new-lowercase-settings>`
are also supported (with the corresponding types):

* **prefetch_multiplier** - :celery_docs:`CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER <userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_prefetch_multiplier>`

-----------------

Section ``[mail]``.

(which is the default when ``host`` is set), these backends are only useful during testing and development.

Configuration options
-----------------------------

This section contains additional information for configure additional elements.

#. If you need set ``https`` for your web settings, you can do it using HAProxy, Nginx, Traefik
   or configure it in ``settings.ini``.

    .. sourcecode:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        addrport = 0.0.0.0:8443,foobar.crt,foobar.key

#. We strictly do not recommend running the web server from root. Use HTTP proxy to run on privileged ports.
